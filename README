The journey began in 1997 with a 1st toolkit.  The mane alternatives at
the time were Xaw, TK, Motif, XView.  They were really bad.  GTK & Qt
were just getting started.  Qt was still royalty based.

25 years later, the alternatives are still really bad so the decision
was made to make Guicast a standalone library.  All the video editing
features are disabled in global_config.  A basic theme is used.
