The journey began in 1997 with a 1st toolkit for Broadcast 1.0 called
BCBase.  The mane alternatives at the time were Xaw, TK, Motif, XView. 
They were really bad.  GTK & Qt were just getting started.  Qt was still
royalty based.

It was renamed Guicast to be more general purpose but it remaned tied to
video editing.

25 years later, the alternatives are still really bad so the decision
was made to make Guicast a standalone library.  All the video editing
features are disabled in global_config.  A basic theme is used.


There are some dependencies:

    apt install xorg
    apt install libx11-dev
    apt install libxext-dev
    apt install libxv-dev
    apt install libxft-dev
    apt install libxfixes-dev
